# Personal-LeetCode-Solutions-Java
A collection of the LeetCode practice problems I have solved using Java. Generally, I try to solve at least one problem a day

Each folder in this repository corresponds to the title of each LeetCode problem, and contains a markdown file of the problem description alongside my Java solution to the problem. Each problem was solved to the best of my ability in terms of time complexity (O(N) or faster for the most part). However, many of the algorithmic solutions are not perfect as they are not direct copies of the top solutions.

Note: This repository is still currently being updated.
